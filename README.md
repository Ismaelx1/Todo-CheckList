# Todo-CheckList
            This chrome extension or app would serve to motivate people into enjoying the process of learning anything by using the biological reward system of our brains.

#How It'll work :
            1 - Set small goals throughout the day that will help you learn, make sure the goal you set is not too difficult if it is and you know it'd take a couple of hours or days break it into bite sizes.
                Example: Learn Xyz | Do Exercises about Xyz | Build or solve a micro problem for your project etc...

            2 - Once the Task is done check the box and enjoy the dopamine rush, you earned it.

#Why this works? 
            You want to do tasks to feel rewarded if they're too big deconstruct them because you want to build a positive feedback loop of Work/Reward which would make the process of coding or learning anything basically enjoyable and here you're enjoying yourself short term with dopamine while also making sure you're long term goals are not neglected.

            What we don't want is you working too hard with no apparent reward which would make the idea of quitting and binge watching Netflix while hating yourself all the more plausible.
